Looking at the overall copy number changes (page 2), we see that  we have a duplication (3 copies), 2 deletions (1 copy) and a copy neutral section. 

Looking at the copy number per allele (page 1), we see that:
 - The duplication is compose of the A allele in 2 copies and the B allele in 1 copy. 
 - The deletions show the presence of the A allele in 1 copy and the absence of the B allele.
 - The copy neutral section is only composed of the A allele in 2 copies and the absence of the B allele

From this results it is likely that, in fact:
 - the full chromsome is triploid (2 A + 1 B) 
 - there is a massive deletion of the B copy (130-166 Mb)
 - there are 2 smaller deletions of one of the A copies (130-135 Mb and 140 Mb)
