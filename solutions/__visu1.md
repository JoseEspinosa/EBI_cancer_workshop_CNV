First if we look at the normal profile :
 - The whole profile is flat almost all a long the region (50x coverage)
 - One peak and a small drop can be observe
 
Second if we look at the tumor profile:
 - The first 30Mb show hiher coverage (60x)
 - The next 5Mb show a reduced coverage (40x) with some peaks in it
 - The end of the region show medium coverage (50x) with some peaks and drops
 
We can notice that the drop and peak obesrved in the normal are also found in the tumor
