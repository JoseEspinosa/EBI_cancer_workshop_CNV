Here are the main steps of a SNParray analysis

Starting from a CEL files (1-6) or from LRR and BAF files (3-6):

 1. Normalize probe intensity
 2. Generate genotyping from CEL files
 3. Probe filtering
 4. Segmenetation of LRR and BAF signal
 5. Estimation of the model paremters
 6. CNV calling from segments
