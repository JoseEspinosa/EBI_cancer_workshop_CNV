The cellularity estimate is at the top along with the average ploidy estimate and the standard deviation of the B allele frequency. 

We can see that:
 - The cellularity has been estimated at 48%. 
 - The ploidy value of 2.3 indicates this piece of the genome is probably amplified 
 - The BAF standard deviation 0.08 indicates there should not be long losses of heterozygosity.
